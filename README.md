<h1>Lora Messenger</h1>
<p>This project allows you to communicate through Ebyte's Lora E22 modules using a smartphone with Bluetooth and ESP32.</p>
<p>I managed to establish a connection at a distance of 8-12 km with a device located on the balcony of the 4th floor of the house.</p>
<p>This project is for people who currently do not have access to the Internet and mobile network, but who want to stay connected with other people who have this device.</p>
<p>In the future, a client for a smartphone and the ability to use a keyboard will be added to the project.</p>
<p>At the moment, it is possible to communicate with the device using commands via a COM port and a Bluetooth client for a mobile phone, such as the Serial Bluetooth Terminal application.</p>
